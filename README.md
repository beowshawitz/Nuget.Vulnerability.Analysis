# Introduction 
Nuget publishes a list of vulnerabilities for commonly used assemblies. This list is generated in an JSON file, so reading the data for specific assemblies can be quite tedious. This project consumes this list and caches it, so calls can be made to it for specific assemblies in question. The project currently consists of an API project, Azure Function to handle HTTP requests, and a web front end. You can choose which resource to use in your requesting process. The web version will be more visual, where the other two will be strictly API based. The web and function projects each make calls to the API. The NUGET JSON storage is on the API project.

# Getting Started
The project was written in .NET 6 with an ASP.NET Core/MVC dependency. These dependencies should be downloaded on a build within Visual Studio or a build pipeline. In addition, the NUGET urls that contain the JSON data are within the API project. If the URLs change, that project would need updated.
